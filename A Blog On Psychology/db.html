<p>A Double Bind pattern creates a choice in the other persons mind - and either choice will give you what you want. A typical example of a double bind is being asked by a cashier whether you want to pay with cash or credit. The bottom line is that you will pay, thus the refusal of either option still creates the same result.</p>

<p>A double bind combined good rapport will minimize the amount of antagonism felt when offered to pick the lesser of two evils. The doctor asked, while smiling, <i>"So you want the hypodermic injection in the arm or the hip?"</i> Either way - you got a shot. </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Also, you will get stronger results by adding emotional responses into your double binds. Here are some examples: </p>
<br>
<br>
<p><i>"When you consider how conifortable you feel, you can either linger on it to get the most from it, or you can begin to imagine how much more real pleasure is possible."</i></p> 
<br>
<br>
<p><b>Also: </b></p>
<br>
<br>
<p><i>"Sitting here a person can either just sit back and relax, or they can get comfortable with everything around them."</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<p><b>Here are some darker examples:</b></p>
<br>
<br> 
<p><i>"You can either think about what you did and how it hurt people, or you can let the guilt build up and haunt your every waking moment. "</i></p> 
<p><b>Also:</b></p>
<br>
<br> 
<p><i>"When that feeling of anxiety automatically appears you can either let it grow stronger or you can think about how much stronger it will grow no matter what."</i></p>
