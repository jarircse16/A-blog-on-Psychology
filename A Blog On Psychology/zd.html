<p>The Zero Decision Pattern removes the other person's choices, by simply not offering them one.</p>
<br>
<br> 
<p>When decisions need to be made, the individual first has to have some understanding of what they are deciding. This understanding can act as a barrier to their taking action, so it is often better to make it so that they don't have to choose or decide.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>For example, if Mr. J. is given a choice between X and Y, then he will have to make a mental effort to decide. The Zero Decision Patterns simply removes the choice. So instead of asking, <i>"Would you like to go ahead with the program?"</i> and giving him a choice between saying <i>"yes"</i> or <i>"no,"</i> you might say, <i>"Let's step over to the schedule, and see where you can fit in"</i> or, <i>"The program you'll be in starts on Monday."</i> 
When Mr. J. tells you what he wants, it is important that you tell him he is right for wanting it. That will only make him want it more (people love to be right). Then tell him what to do next. Don't ask. Tell! 
<br>
<br>
<o>So Mr. J. wants service X but can't afford it. First, agree with him for wanting it. <i>"Mr. J, you want X. You're right to want it. Your program starts ... ,"</i> or<i> "Good choice. Here is the program package you'll be using."</i> If Mr. J says, <i>"I don't have the funds,"</i> reply, <i>"Good. Bring what you can, and we'll setup payments. Be here on ... "</i>
<br>
<br> 
<p>If you are putting the zero decision pattern into effect for your business (it's a damn good idea), then you must drill into every employee to direct the client and never to ask. It is also good to write these patterns into the conversational patter your employees are taught to use when dealing with the public. </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>The tone of voice is important, in order to avoid feeling bullied, so consider how you might say it, if you were ordering from a menu, with a kind smile on your face. </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>The unique part of this pattern is that, with ongoing exposure, a person will automatically get used to following the commands. Why wouldn't they? They are simple and not really a choice - just what they are supposed to do!<p> 
<br>
<br>
<p> <b>To summarize the Zero Decision Pattern:</b></p> 
<li>  Find out what they want and why, and agree that they are right and good to want it.</li>
<li> Tell them (don't ask) the very next step and direct them. Don't tell them they need to, and don't offer options. Just tell them to do it. Consider saying it like you were ordering from a menu. No emotion just direction.</li> 
<li> Avoid making a big deal out of your direction. Say it as if it's what everyone does.</li>
