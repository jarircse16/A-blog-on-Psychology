<p>When you find out what is most important to people, you can use it to influence and persuade them. The power of being able to do this is profound and can be used to help or harm. </p>
<br>
<p><i>The key is to uncover their set of values.</i></p> 
<br>
<p>The good news is that it's much easier than you might think. Consider that people love to talk about what is important to them, when someone shows even a little interest. Sometimes, all you have to do is pay attention, and people will give you their hearts (more on this later). Other times, you only need to skillfully ask a few simple questions, and they will tell you everything you want to know about what motivates them.</p>
<br> 
<p>Here is the process. First, understand that there is a context in which you want to influence the other person. This context could be selling a car, thus the context would be "cars." The context could be seduction, thus you would be talking about "romantic encounters." The rule is to keep the conversation within the context. </p>
<br>
<p>Once you are aware of the context, then the question you ask is quite simple.<i> "What's important to you about (context)?"</i></p>
<br> 
<p>So if the context is cars, then the question would be, <i>"What's important to you about a car?"</i> and if the context is love, then the question would be, <i>"What's important to you in a lover?"</i></p>
<br> 
<p>A variation of this question can be, <i>"When you have (context) fully and completely, what does that give you that's important?"</i></p>
<br> 
<p>So, using the examples and this variation, the questions would be,<i> "When you have the car you want, what does that give you that is important?"</i> or, <i>"When you have the lover or sex partner that you truly want, what does that give you that is important?" </i>
<br>
<p>When asking these questions, the first answer is not likely to be their deepest value, but it is important. In order to get to their deepest value for this context, you repeat the questioning cycle.</p>
<br> 
<p>Let's say that your context is seduction, and you are attempting to woo a particular person. The first question asked is, <i>"What's important to you in a lover?"</i> Let us say they answer <i>"romance."</i> So to repeat this process, you would use the word <i>"romance"</i> as they have used it. <i>"When you have romance fully and completely, what does that give you that's important?"</i><p> 
<br>
<p>Let's then suppose the person's answer then becomes <i>"passion."</i></p>
<br> 
<p>This process of questioning would continue, until you reach their highest value. As a general rule, you will likely only have to repeat this process three times, sometimes less and sometimes more. How will you know their highest value has been reached? Pay attention, and look for some expression of emotion.</p>
<br> 
<p>Keep in mind that these are people's highest values within this context, and for them to talk about it is bound to elicit emotions of some sort. This emotional response may be subtle or overt. It might not be tears, but you will want to pay attention to their response.</p>
<br> 
<p>So, knowing that her first answer is <i>"romance"</i> and then <i>"passion,"</i> you ask again. <i>"What is ultimately important to you about passion?"</i> Let's suppose their answer is <i>"That would fulfill my deepest desire." </i></p>
<br>
<p>Keep in mind that we are only half way through the entire values elicitation process. Often this first half of the process of elicitation is enough for the person to begin to link these powerful values to you or your product. </p>
<br>
<p>Let's continue with the entire process.</p>
<br>
<p>Next, you use their answers to link their values to you or your product.</p> 
<p><i>So you know that <b>"romance"</b> and <b>"passion"</b> are part of what makes their vision of an ideal partner and that ,ultimately, passion would <b>"fulfill (her) deepest desire."</b> All you do is work those exact words into the description of your values, or demonstrate them in your behavior. </i></p>
<br>
<p>You might later say something like, <i>"When I think about the things that make a relationship worthwhile, there has to be a feeling of romance and passion, in order to fulfill my deepest desires," or "I don't know how well you can sit there and look at me as we talk, and know that there is, deep inside, a sense of romance and passion that will be there to fulfill your deepest desire."</i>
<br> 
<p>At first, this may sound mechanical and contrived, but keep in mind that you are talking about their highest values, and it has a very powerful effect. This pattern is so powerful that it can influence people to do things they would not normally do. </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<center><b><i>Warning!!!</b></i></center> 
<p>If this pattern is done to someone in a "dark" way, and they are persuaded to expect something you cannot live up to, then it is likely you will have made an enemy for life - or worse. You may have created someone who is compelled to hunt you down and kill you. Remember, this is manipulation on the level of a person's deepest values. </p>
