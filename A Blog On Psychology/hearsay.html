<p>To the rational mind, hearsay is untrustworthy. But, as you already know, the female mind is <b>hardly (read: never) rational.</b> To a woman, hearsay is often taken as the truth, especially if the information has been deliberately hidden from her for a good reason.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>As  you’d  expect,  the “Hearsay” technique is regularly used as a Mind Control device by many expert manipulators and con artists. It is often used to make the victim feel deeply insecure, and to exploit that insecurity to ruin the victim’s relationships with other people. </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Like the <b>“Prophesy”</b> technique, you can use it on your target to inoculate her against the advances of another man, or more insidiously, to destroy her relationship with her boyfriend if she has one. You can deploy this tactic more effectively when you’ve got an accomplice or a pawn who can spread hearsay on your behalf.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Imagine a scenario where you can get your accomplice to tell her,<i> “Do you know how proud he is to have you as his woman? He’s been bragging to his friends about how happy he is that he has got someone as smart and sexy like you as his partner. I don’t think he’ll tell this to you straight because he thinks he might embarrass you. Just so you know.”</i> By revealing this to her on a “second hand” basis via the accomplice, the impact is much stronger. </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Similarly, you can use an accomplice to spread hearsay about her boyfriend, or anyone you want her to be segregated from. I won't leave it to your imagination and creativity to come up with ideas that you can get your accomplice to feed her to completely destroy her boyfriend.  Imagine a scenario where you can get your accomplice to tell her, <i> “Do you know how unhappy he is to have you as his woman? He’s been bragging to his friends about how nasty your character is and treats you as a prostitute. He is that he has got someone as foolish and stupid like you as his partner whom he is going to break her heart into pieces. I don’t think he’ll tell this to you straight because he thinks he might hurt you. Just so you know.”</i> By revealing this to her on a “second hand” basis via the accomplice, the impact is much stronger. </p>
