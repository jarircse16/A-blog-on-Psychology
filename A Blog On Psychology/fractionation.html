<p>
Fractionation is  the  “big  bad  wolf”  of  all covert seduction techniques - this has been the foundation of the infamous <b>"October Man Sequence"</b> which was featured in the book <b>“The  Game”</b>  by  <b>Neil  Strauss.</b> The inventor of this technique has claimed to be able to make a woman develop super intense emotional connection (which usually takes <b>MONTHS</b> or <b>YEARS</b> to build) in as little as 15 minutes using this technique. </p>
<br>
<br> 
<p>Fractionation is based on hypnosis and <b>NLP</b> ... but don't worry. You don't need to know much about hypnosis or <b>NLP</b> to pull this off. </p> 
<br>
<br>
<p>In fact, I will show you how easy it is to use this technique to approach women that you will instantly forget that you even need those cheesy pickup lines in the first place.</p> 
<br>
<br>
<p>The Fractionation tactic is based on what they call "positive-negative theory" in hypnosis. This is where you talk about things which are pleasurable (positive), and then immediately followed about things which are painful (negative). </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Again, don’t worry that it sounds somehow complicated. Just follow the examples below and you will understand this tactic better.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p><b>Here's one example... </p></b>
<br>
<br>
<p><i>"Do you remember the time when your best friend is just next to you, and it makes you feel tremendously happy. You feel important, appreciated and loved. Can you imagine now how that feels? (Pause) I used to, but then one day my best friend got sick and she died almost immediately she got warded in the hospital. (Pause) She was gone."</i><p> 
<br>
<br>
As you can see, I mix up the feelings of both <b>SADNESS</b> and <b>HAPPINESS</b> in the same sentence – and hence getting her to experience both emotions at the same time. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
Another example... 
<br>
<br>
<p><i>"Have you ever met a person who you feel that he is meant to be with you? (Point to yourself subtly) Even if  you've only met him for five minutes, you knew deep down inside you that he will be an important part of your life, whether as a partner or only a friend. (Pause) I have experienced that 
myself. I met someone who I grew very close to very quickly. But only a few days later she got into a horrible car accident. She was gone."</i></p>
<br> 
<br>
<p>In the above example, the act of subtly pointing to yourself is the anchor. The key to this seduction tactic is to associate (i.e. anchor) yourself with the <b>GOOD</b> feelings. </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Another way to anchor is to look deep into her eyes when you talk about the positive things, and look <b>AWAY</b> when talking about negative things. This way, by looking away later you will “give her pain” - exactly what you need to get her to obey whatever you ask her to do.</p>
