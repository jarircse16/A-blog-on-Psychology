<p>Ronald F. LeBlanc, the world famous sales trainer once told me over a private chat session hosted by the <b>MKULTRA</b>,<i>“Jarir, there’s this subtle tactic that I teach my salesmen that discourages their customers from going elsewhere to do business.”</i></p> 
<br>
<br>
<p>My interest was immediately piqued; I knew that whatever he told me would be readily applicable to dating and relationships. <i>“Which is?”</i> I asked.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p><i>“I call this tactic, <b>‘Prophesy’.</b> When the customer starts to get restless and wants to go shop elsewhere, I first disarm her, by encouraging her to do so. Then, I’ll suggest that she will just be wasting her time by <b>“predicting’</b> what happens when she goes see a competitor. For example, I’ll say, feel free to go to shop so-and-so, but there will be higher prices, or smaller variety, or less flexibility.'</i>”<p> 
<br>
<br>
<p><i>“OK. But how does that help you?”</i> I asked.</p> 
<br>
<br>
<p>He smiled. <i>“Simple! If the customer is convinced and decides to stay put, I win. If the customer decides to go to the other shop, discovers that what I said was true and then comes back, I win. If she doesn’t return, well, I’m no worse off than before!” </i></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Cults use the <b>“Prophesy” </b> tactic when they recruit new members into their group. For example, they <b>“prophesize”</b> that a new joiner would be mocked and derided by her friends and family for her decision to join the cult. </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Similarly, doctors also use this tactic on their patients: when asked if they (the patients) would get better, his stock <b>“Prophesy” </b>answer would be:<i> “It will get worse for the next few days before it gets better.”</i> If the patient gets better immediately, then she will credit the doctor’s treatment. On the other hand, if it indeed gets worse, she will also credit the doctor for his <b>“accurate”</b> prediction. </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Either way, the doctor wins.</p>  
<br>
<br>
<p>Now think for a moment how you can apply this strategy on your target. In particular, you can use it to <b>“inoculate”</b> your target against any attempts by other guys to seduce her or use Boyfriend Destroyer sequences on her. For example, you can say, <i>“You’re free to go with him, of course. But you should already know some things about him which are not ideal now, something undesirable, or something that annoys you... and you will find more and more of these undesirable things as you know him more.”</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Of course, to protect your woman from getting preyed on by men who know Boyfriend Destroyers, you may also consider another option which can seem to be at least more morally palatable. You can treat her more nicely and lovingly that she wouldn’t consider leaving you for another man, for example. </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>However, as you should already know, this option wouldn’t be practical simply because not a lot of women are capable of being so loyal. In order to preserve the relationship, you must see the female’s nature for what it is and do what can seem to be morally repugnant by the society. </p>
